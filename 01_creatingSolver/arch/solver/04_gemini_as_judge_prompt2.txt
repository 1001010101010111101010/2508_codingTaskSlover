Prompt 2 â€” Unify the workflows after review (apply judgments and my review notes)

You are an expert workflow editor. Using the prior comparison output and my review notes, produce a single unified workflow and a change log.

Inputs:

- Original Left Workflow: {LEFT_WORKFLOW}

- Original Right Workflow: {RIGHT_WORKFLOW}

- Comparison Output (the full numbered list produced earlier): {COMPARISON_OUTPUT}

- My Review Notes (overrides by item number; if not mentioned, keep your original judgment): {REVIEW_NOTES}

Tasks:

1. Apply decisions

- For each numbered item (and sub-item), apply my review override if provided; otherwise, use your original Judgment.
- Resolve conflicts fully. If truly impossible to resolve with given info, list the specific unresolved questions at the end.

2. Produce the Unified Workflow

- Deliver a clean, logically ordered list of steps. Keep step wording precise and concise.

- When the chosen action is:

  - Keep Left: use the Left step text as-is.
  - Keep Right: use the Right step text as-is.
  - Merge: synthesize a single step that captures the best of both, removing redundancy and contradictions.
  - Remove: omit the step.

- Ensure consistency of terms, roles, inputs/outputs, and pre/post-conditions across steps.

- If items were split (e.g., 7a, 7b), ensure the final ordering is coherent and avoids duplication.

3. Provide a Change Log

- For each item from the comparison (including sub-items), report:

  - Item: number (e.g., 12 or 7a)
  - Action Taken: Kept Left | Kept Right | Merged | Removed
  - Rationale: reference your original Comment and any specific review override. Be brief.

4. Provide any Open Questions (only if needed)

- If something cannot be resolved without more input, list clear, specific questions.

Output format:

- Section: Unified Workflow
  - Numbered list of final steps
- Section: Change Log
  - Bullet list by item number with Action Taken and brief Rationale
- Section: Open Questions (only if needed)

Deliver only these sections. Do not include the original workflows again in the output.
