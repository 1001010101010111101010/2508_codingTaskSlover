Below is an optimized, end-to-end, single-pass workflow with tightened prompts P1–P8. I’ve made each prompt precise, machine-parsable, idempotent, and designed for automation (one agentic go). For each step I also explain why the revision is better. At the end, I include a contrarian review to challenge the approach.

High-level orchestration notes
1. Single-pass flow: P1 (vision-only via ChatGPT GUI) → P2 → P3 → P4 → P5 → P6 → P7 → P8.
2. Filesystem contract:
   - If the agent can write files: write exactly to the paths specified.
   - If not, output each file as a single fenced code block starting with a header line: FILE: <relative/path>.
3. Re-entrancy: Every step must be deterministic and safe to rerun. Steps re-read docs/*.md, reconcile with existing files, and do minimal changes.
4. Blocking logic: If P3 produces BLOCKERs and docs/risksAnswers.md is empty, P4–P8 proceed with clearly labeled Assumptions and low-regret defaults; all such assumptions are recorded inline in their files.

Adjusted prompts and workflow

P1 (GPT-4o) — Image Analysis & Text Extraction (Vision)
Prompt
You are in strict OCR + extraction mode.

Task:
1) Perform OCR on the provided image(s) of a coding task. Preserve character-level fidelity exactly. Do not infer corrections. Mark uncertain characters by wrapping them with [??] exactly and assign a confidence % per line.
2) Extract verbatim items into categories: code snippets, requirements, constraints. These must be direct substrings of the raw OCR text.
3) Note any diagram/visual elements that do not translate to text (e.g., arrows, boxes, swimlanes).
4) Output a single fenced code block with the following sections in order:
   - SECTION: raw_ocr_lines
     - One line per OCR line, exact characters, no normalization.
   - SECTION: meta
     - For each line: index, confidencePercent (0–100), uncertainCharacterSpans (list of [start,end] indices within the line for [??]-wrapped characters).
   - SECTION: extracted_items
     - requirements: list of objects {text, sourceLineIndices}
     - constraints: list of objects {text, sourceLineIndices}
     - codeSnippets: list of objects {text, sourceLineIndices}
     All text values must be exact substrings from raw_ocr_lines.
   - SECTION: diagram_notes
     - Numbered list of non-textual/structural elements observed.
   - SECTION: normalized_numbered_text
     - Present the non-code textual content as a numbered list (1., 2., 3., …) without altering the actual text content (only add numbering). For code, include in code blocks without line numbers.

Rules:
- Do not add bold/italics or extra decoration.
- Do not change any characters in raw_ocr_lines.
- If bullets/dashes are used in the image text, do not change them in raw_ocr_lines; normalized_numbered_text may prefix numbering but must not alter the underlying words.
- Use a single fenced code block with language tag text.

Why this is better
1) Separation of concerns: Raw OCR stays pristine; normalized view is clearly separate to avoid accidental mutations.
2) Machine-parsable: Clear sections enable downstream automation to reliably consume outputs.
3) Ambiguity capture: Confidence + [??] spans make uncertainty explicit for later risk analysis.
4) Diagram awareness: Non-text elements are captured so they can be translated into requirements/architecture later.

P2 — Surgical Goal Definition
Prompt
Read docs/task.md. Produce a single-sentence, hyper-specific implementation target using this exact template:

Develop [EXACT WHAT] that must [CRITICAL FUNCTION] within [TIMEBOX], specifically handling [KEY CONSTRAINT] through [REQUIRED TECHNIQUE]. Exclusions: [OUT-OF-SCOPE ITEMS].

Constraints:
1) Use only concrete nouns/verbs. No vague adjectives (robust, scalable, etc.).
2) Include the TIMEBOX from docs/task.md (timebox section). If absent, assume a conservative default and mark it as an assumption inside the file.
3) Length ≤ 220 characters. If longer, tighten phrasing without losing specificity.
4) Output:
   - If filesystem is writable: write to docs/goal.md (overwrite).
   - Else: emit as a single fenced code block starting with: FILE: docs/goal.md

Why this is better
1) Eliminates ambiguity by forcing a compact, testable sentence.
2) Enforces timebox binding directly from the source.
3) Keeps content short for easy reuse in later steps.

P3 — Threat Modeling & Knowledge Gaps
Prompt
Read docs/task.md and docs/goal.md. Generate numbered risk/ambiguity pairs in this format:

[TITLE]: [Why it matters] | [If unresolved]
Priority: [BLOCKER|HIGH|MEDIUM]
If BLOCKER: Questions:
1) ...
2) ...
3) ...
Fallback assumption (if no answer by next step): ...

Include at least:
- Core uncertainties (requirements, data, interfaces)
- Technical risks (performance, tooling, environment)
- Edge cases (inputs, concurrency, failure modes)

Then:
1) Write your analysis to docs/risks.md (overwrite).
2) If docs/risksAnswers.md does not exist, create an empty file docs/risksAnswers.md.
3) If docs/risksAnswers.md exists and contains any answers, mark corresponding risks as Resolved and update their priority accordingly.

If no filesystem: emit both files as separate fenced code blocks with FILE: headers.

Why this is better
1) Enforces a consistent, scannable format with explicit fallbacks.
2) Links Q&A loop via risksAnswers.md to lower rework later.
3) Uses prioritization that later steps can act on.

P4 — Constraint-Driven Strategy
Prompt
Read docs/task.md, docs/goal.md, docs/risks.md, docs/risksAnswers.md. Create a solution blueprint answering:

1) What 20% of features deliver 80% of the value?
2) What technical debts are acceptable in the timebox (and why)?
3) What cannot change post-commit (interface contracts, formats, SLAs)?
4) Patterns: Applicable design/concurrency patterns (only if directly justified).
5) Time Allocation: Break down the timebox into major buckets (e.g., Spec, TDD, Impl, Tests, Polish). The sum must equal the timebox. If the timebox is unknown, state your assumed timebox and why.
6) Assumptions activated due to unresolved BLOCKERs from risks.md (cite IDs). Each assumption must be minimal and low-regret.

Output:
- Write to docs/strategy.md (overwrite). If FS unavailable, emit as a single fenced code block with FILE: docs/strategy.md.

Why this is better
1) Prioritizes outcomes via 80/20 lens to maximize value under timebox.
2) Time breakdown ties plan to reality and prevents over-planning.
3) Immutable post-commit items reduce churn.

P5 — Atomic Requirements
Prompt
Read docs/task.md, docs/goal.md, docs/risks.md, docs/risksAnswers.md, docs/strategy.md. List verifiable requirements:

Functional:
F1. [Action] → [Inputs] → [Outputs] → [Primary success criteria]
F2. ...
Non-Functional:
NF1. [Constraint] → [Metric/Threshold] → [Measurement method]
NF2. ...

For each F/NF, add a direct test mapping: Test: Txx (human-readable test name).
Mark conflicts with ⚠️ and cite the conflicting IDs.

Output:
- Write to docs/requirements.md (overwrite). If FS unavailable, emit FILE: docs/requirements.md.

Why this is better
1) Every requirement is testable and tied to a concrete test.
2) Conflicts are explicitly flagged early, not discovered during coding.

P6 — Anti-Pattern Safeguards
Prompt
Read docs/task.md, docs/goal.md, docs/risks.md, docs/risksAnswers.md, docs/strategy.md, docs/requirements.md. Design a guardrail plan:

1) Anti-pattern defenses:
   - [Common pitfall]: [Detection method] → [Prevention/Refactor path]
   - At least 5 entries targeting known risks from docs/risks.md.
2) Concurrency model justification (or “No concurrency” with justification). Include data-sharing policy, synchronization strategy, and back-pressure/queueing approach if applicable.        
3) Error handling hierarchy:
   - Error classes or categories
   - When to fail fast vs. degrade gracefully
   - Logging policy and observability hooks

Output:
- Write to docs/cautions.md (overwrite). If FS unavailable, emit FILE: docs/cautions.md.

Why this is better
1) Converts vague caution into actionable detection/prevention.
2) Forces a conscious concurrency and error-handling stance.

P7 — Component Blueprint
Prompt
Read docs/task.md, docs/goal.md, docs/risks.md, docs/risksAnswers.md, docs/strategy.md, docs/requirements.md, docs/cautions.md. Define components:

For each:
C1 ([Role]):
- Does: [Primary responsibility]
- Exposes: [Public methods/signatures or CLI contracts]
- Hides: [Encapsulated logic/state]
- Talks to: [Dependencies]
- Mock points: [Interfaces or seams] // MOCKABLE

Component graph:
- Layers: ≤ 3 total
- Show adjacency as lists: Layer 1: [C1, C2], Layer 2: [C3], Layer 3: [C4]
- Identify any “god components” and propose decomposition if needed.

Output:
- Write to docs/proposedArchitecture.md (overwrite). If FS unavailable, emit FILE: docs/proposedArchitecture.md.

Why this is better
1) Enforces layering discipline and mocks by design.
2) Keeps public surface clear and test-friendly.

P8 — Implementation (Coder, TDD, timebox-aware)
Prompt
You are now the coder. Implement the task defined in docs/task.md, guided by docs/goal.md, docs/risks.md, docs/risksAnswers.md, docs/strategy.md, docs/requirements.md, docs/cautions.md, docs/proposedArchitecture.md.

Rules:
1) Timebox: Adhere strictly to the “timebox” from docs/task.md. If it is absent, use the assumed timebox from docs/strategy.md and proceed.
2) Happy-Path Contracts:
   - Re-assess docs/proposedArchitecture.md:
     a) If task.md specifies work within a single class, prefer staying within that class and use inline comments to represent components (e.g., // Component1: ...).
     b) Only create multiple classes if it clearly lowers complexity and follows the architecture.
   - When creating classes, include:
     - Final class names and method signatures
     - Input preconditions (e.g., @NonNull or equivalent)
     - Success postconditions
     - // MOCKABLE tags for external interactions
3) Test-Led Implementation (if task.md requires TDD, follow strictly):
   - For each F[X]:
     a) Write a failing test (JUnit5 + Mockito or the stack required by task.md)
     b) Implement minimal code to pass
     c) Keep cyclomatic complexity < 5 per method (refactor otherwise)
     d) If stuck > 5 minutes:
        i) Provide 2–3 alternative approaches
        ii) State complexity/time trade-offs
        iii) Escalate with a concise question in a comment (and proceed with lowest-risk assumption)
   - Cover NF[X] via measurable tests or tooling (benchmarks, limits, lint rules).
4) Complexity Triage:
   - Run coverage (e.g., Jacoco) and flag untested complex methods (CC ≥ 7)
   - Refactor only high-risk complexity and false-positive-prone code
   - Avoid gold-plating or unnecessary renaming
5) Iteration Pivot Rule:
   - If you hit 3 consecutive code-compile errors on the same feature, pivot approach. After 4 total iterations, drastically simplify or change direction.
6) Build/Test:
   - Use the build tool and language from docs/task.md (Maven/Gradle/npm/etc.).
   - If not specified, choose a reasonable default based on language in task.md and state your assumption in a top-level comment.
7) Output:
   - Write code and tests to the correct project structure.
   - Ensure tests pass.
   - If filesystem is unavailable, emit all files as multiple fenced code blocks each starting with: FILE: <path>, followed by file content.

Why this is better
1) Explicitly encodes the pivot rule to avoid endless churn.
2) Enforces measurable outcomes and coverage on the riskiest code.
3) Keeps implementation aligned to earlier decisions while allowing pragmatic simplification.

Additional orchestration helpers (optional but recommended)
- P0 (optional bootstrap): Create docs/ if missing. If FS unavailable, switch to FILE: blocks.
- Consistency check after P5 and P7: A quick lint that the requirements map to components and tests (can be folded into P7).

Contrarian / negative-thinking review (where this could fail and what you might need to provide)

1) OCR fidelity vs. normalization conflict
   - Risk: P1 demands exact OCR while adding numbering in normalized text. A careless agent might “fix” typos or alter content.
   - Mitigation: Strict separation of raw_ocr_lines (immutable) and normalized_numbered_text (adds only numbering). You should verify P1’s raw vs. normalized section on the first run.       

2) Missing or vague timebox
   - Risk: Many steps depend on timebox. If docs/task.md lacks it, the plan relies on assumptions.
   - Mitigation: Provide a clear timebox in docs/task.md. If not, P4 will state an assumed timebox; confirm or override early.

3) Unresolved BLOCKERs in risks
   - Risk: Proceeding with assumptions can misalign implementation.
   - Mitigation: Fill docs/risksAnswers.md promptly with authoritative answers. If you cannot, confirm the fallback assumptions P3/P4 wrote.

4) Language/build ambiguity
   - Risk: P8 may guess language/build system incorrectly if task.md is not explicit.
   - Mitigation: Specify language, minimum version, test framework, and build tool in docs/task.md. If missing, the agent will choose defaults and note assumptions.

5) File system and tool limits
   - Risk: Agents without file write access or build tooling cannot create files or run tests.
   - Mitigation: The FILE: <path> emission format covers no-FS scenarios; you’ll need to copy files locally and run tests yourself.

6) Over-prescription for small tasks
   - Risk: The full spec/risks/architecture process could be heavy for a trivial task, reducing velocity.
   - Mitigation: The prompts encourage 80/20 and minimalism. If task.md scope is tiny, the agent should produce short, proportional outputs.

7) Coverage/complexity metrics availability
   - Risk: Jacoco or similar tools might not be available in the environment.
   - Mitigation: P8 falls back to reporting intended coverage and CC; you may need to run locally. You can pre-configure build scripts in the repo to ensure they exist.

8) Vision limitations
   - Risk: P1 might miss characters for low-contrast or rotated text; [??] flags might proliferate.
   - Mitigation: Provide the clearest possible image. If critical parts are unreadable, add a companion text version in docs/task.md.

9) Diagram semantics loss
   - Risk: Complex diagram logic isn’t fully captured by textual notes.
   - Mitigation: Provide a textual explanation in docs/task.md or allow the agent to propose a diagram-to-text translation (e.g., sequence steps) for your approval.

10) Strict single-sentence goal could exclude nuance
   - Risk: P2’s brevity might exclude secondary objectives.
   - Mitigation: The nuance is captured in P3–P7; P2 is for the north-star statement only.

11) Pivot rule could halt progress prematurely
   - Risk: A challenging feature might need more than four iterations.
   - Mitigation: The prompt suggests drastic simplification rather than stopping entirely—still progress, just with reduced scope.

12) Architecture constraint of ≤3 layers
   - Risk: Some systems need more depth.
   - Mitigation: This is a default guardrail for simplicity. If task.md mandates more, the agent should justify an exception in P7.

13) Ambiguous “single class” mandate
   - Risk: P8’s “single class if task.md says so” might compress design too much.
   - Mitigation: P8 includes a re-assessment clause; it can still factor out helpers when it reduces complexity without violating constraints.

14) Non-determinism in model outputs
   - Risk: Slight phrasing differences could cause format drift.
   - Mitigation: Each prompt demands a single fenced code block, defined sections, and FILE: headers where needed to help downstream parsing.

If you share docs/task.md and any initial image(s), I can tailor these prompts to your exact stack and constraints (language, build tool, CI, expected artifacts) and pre-populate assumptions to reduce risk before you run the pipeline.
