Prompt 1 — Side-by-side comparison (WinMerge-style), judgment, and numbered review queue

You are an expert process analyst. Perform a rigorous, WinMerge-style comparison of two workflows side-by-side.

Objectives:

- Align, match, and compare steps from the Left and Right workflows, even if steps are reordered, merged, or split.
- Identify and label: Left-only, Same, Different, Right-only.
- Make a judgment for each comparison item: Keep Left, Keep Right, Merge, Remove.
- Assess importance: Critical, High, Medium, Low.
- Explain briefly why you made each judgment.
- Number each comparison item so I can review and reference them easily.
- Do not produce a unified workflow yet. End with a signal that you’re waiting for my review.

Inputs:

- Left Workflow: {LEFT_WORKFLOW}

- Right Workflow: {RIGHT_WORKFLOW}

Method and requirements:

1. Normalization and alignment

- Normalize step boundaries and terminology to improve matching quality.

- Align steps using best-match logic:

  - If a Left step maps clearly to a Right step, pair them.
  - If no reasonable match, mark as Left-only or Right-only.
  - If one step maps to multiple smaller steps or vice versa, split into sub-items (e.g., 7a, 7b) under the same parent comparison number.

2. Output format

- Provide a concise Summary first:

  - Counts: Left-only, Right-only, Same, Different.
  - Brief notes on major themes or risks.

- Then provide a Numbered Comparison List (start at 1 and increment by 1; use sub-letters a/b/c only for splits): For each item i (or i.a / i.b for splits), include the following fields exactly:

  - ID: i (or i.a, i.b)
  - Left: "Exact left text" or — if none
  - Right: "Exact right text" or — if none
  - Category: Left-only | Same | Different | Right-only
  - Importance: Critical | High | Medium | Low
  - Judgment: Keep Left | Keep Right | Merge | Remove
  - Comment: one-sentence rationale for the judgment

- Preserve original wording in Left/Right fields; do not paraphrase there.

- If a step is moved, treat it as Matched (Different or Same), not as new-only, and note “reordered” in Comment.

- Keep items stable and unambiguous so I can reference “Item 12” (or “12.b”) in review.

3. End state

- Do not merge or rewrite the workflows yet.
- After the numbered list, output: READY_FOR_REVIEW

Deliver only the comparison as specified above and end with READY_FOR_REVIEW.
